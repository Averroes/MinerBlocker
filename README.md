# AntiMiner - #1 Coin Minerblock
Antiminer blocks any hidden miners on every website you visit! Antiminer Miner Blocker allows you to prevent cryptojacking scripts from mining using your CPU. At the moment Anti miner blocks Javascripts that are mining coins for Monero, Dash and other like coinhive (coin-hive) and jsecoin.

### Why ?
Even though I think using coin mining in browser to monetize content is a great idea, abusing it is not. Some websites are running it during the entire browsing session. In this case the result is a high consumption of your computers resources. I believe the solution is in using it occasionally such as for the proof of work of a captcha. But anyway, the user should have the choice to opt-in for an entire browsing session. It's the aim of this extension.

### Why not just block the URLs in an adblocker ?
The idea was in opportunity to keep it separate from adblocking. Coin mining in the browser is a different thing. Where ads are tracking you and visually interfering with your browsing experience, coin mining, if abused, is eating your computer resources. The result is slow downs (from high CPU usage) and excessive power consumption. You might be OK with that and not with ads, or vice versa. And you might just want to keep ads blocked entirely and just enable the coin mining script for a minute to pass a Captcha. That's why separate extension will be very useful in your working.

### How does it work ?
The extension is simply blocking a list of blacklisted domains. Clicking on the icon will display you a button to pause/unpause AntiMiner. If you are aware of any scripts or services that provide coin mining the browser, please submit a PR.
